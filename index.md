## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How do I use iHearNow?**
A: Click on Group Mode if you are with people who also have the app running. 
Click on Solo Mode if you are the only one with the app and want to hear what others speak into your phone. 

**Q: Why do I need a headset?**
A: The app is supposed to help in loud environments. The headset helps to only hear the conversation, not the noise.

**Q: Does the headset have to be Bluetooth, or can I use one with a cable?**
A: A headset with a cable makes sense in Group Mode. In Solo Mode, you will pass the phone araound and the cable will be an issue.

A: The app was tested with the SoundPeats Q30 Bluetooth Headphones. If you want to use a headset with a cable, the standard Apple EarPods work well.
